// Twitter API instructions only

create an init() function of some sort to load up all of the dependencies
Ti.include('lib/sha1.js');
Ti.include('lib/oauth.js');
Ti.include('lib/oauth_adapter.js');
Ti.include('lib/twitter_api.js');

You can set this up any way you feel fit, and store them in different directories. The order of loading is important.

This version of the script is still a little rough and can do with some tidying up.

twitter_api.js requires your secret and key information.

Main Issues:
===========

Android still shows a save password dialog box underneath the web view - I have altered the height and position of the webview 
for android so you can see this. Fixes and alternatives will need to be found.

GET & POST both work
Web Pin scraping method used to autehnticate, although there are other ways which I will ecplore in time.
process queue does not work, so you will need to authenticate and then use the api calls. I will figure out how best to queue
the calls up and update this script to streamline its behaviour.


The best method of sending a POST or GET is to run a check for the tokens file if found then set up a send request in the following format:

eg. POST (Status Update)

oa.oAuthAdapter.send({
	url:'https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json', 
	parameters:[
		['display_coordinates','true'],
		['place_id','8ef32ff56ef11c22'],
		['include_entities',1],
		['status', 'It\'s now '+d+'. Testing twitter mobile app using http://goo.gl/sQxUE on '+ Ti.Platform.name +' #appcelerator']
	],
	method:'POST',
	onSuccess:function(response){
		rText = JSON.parse(response.responseText);
	},
	onError:function(response){
		alert(response.errorMessage);
		rText = JSON.parse(response.responseText);
	}
});


TO send a GET request, just change the method from 'POST' to 'GET' - to understand this further, please look at the testWindow.js file.

You will want to set up a function or callback from within the onSuccess events so that you can manipulate the return data.
