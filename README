This example app contains the twitter oAuth library.

the app example sends debug messages onto the screen as certain events occur, you can also test various twitter options.

1) Sign In - loads a webview up
2) close/cancel buttons on this modal window
3) PIN retrieval and local saving of return tokens for authenticated requests
4) POST a test status update 
5) GET verify credentials (data on the logged in user)
6) CLEAR / destroy the local token file.
7) API requests work on both android and iOS
8) 1.7.2 tested

KNOWN ISSUES
============

Queueing does not work, you have to sign in first then use the API calls.
Clearing local token file data will then require you to restart, unti then API calls still occur
callbacks and code structure needs to nbe reviewed and tightened
printMessage function is a little skewey in android.

The core library which is in another github project has not yet been brought up to date with this test app, I will decide if it should be maintained
seperately.
